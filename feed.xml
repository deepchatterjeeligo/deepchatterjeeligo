degree. Needless to say it is one of the more anticipated events of this long
journey which in my case lasted almost five years. While the thesis submission
is the final milestone, I think many would agree that the defense is the
&lt;strong&gt;main thing&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, though anticipated, some anxiety is expected.
There are slight differences how the defense is conducted depending
on the university. At UW-Milwaukee, it has an open-to-all public session,
followed by a private session where the candidate is tested by the individual
members of the committee. Also, as far as what could be asked, the sky is the
limit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My defense date was on April 16, 2020, right in the middle of the coronavirus
crisis. The first major academic conference that was canceled due to the spread
of COVID-19 was the APS March Meeting, schduled to happen in the first week
of March. I remember this well since my roommate was supposed to leave for Denver
for the meeting on a morning flight. He got the news of cancellation around
10 PM the night before. Personally, I had plans to visit my fiancee in Dallas,
TX during the first weekend in March. The following week there was a
face-to-face working meeting at UWM, and week after it was supposed to
be the LIGO-Virgo collaboration meeting. But little did I know that my
3 day visit to Dallas would turn into a 3 month long stay in shelter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the impact of COVID-19 took off about the second week of March,
around the time it was declared a pandemic. Academic conferences were canceled,
visits were suspended. Eventually by the middle of March most universities
suspended in-person classes, campuses were shut, and employees were asked to
work from home. It became clear that the defense would have to be remote.
I’ll admit that the remote-part of the defense did not bother me much. Working
and presenting remotely was something I am used to for most of my time as
a graduate student. It is fairly common for researchers in large, distributed
scientific collaboration to work routinely with someone at a different
institution, possibly across the globe. One concern was to manage a
&lt;em&gt;chalkboard&lt;/em&gt; for the defense - an essential component for a physics defense.
But that was easily resolved via screen sharing using my tablet. It was, in
a sense, easier to get set up. I did not have to be at a particular room
before time, no need to fiddle with the projector and find the cable that
works, or find the laser pointer! I joined the &lt;a href=&quot;https://zoom.us/&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;
meeting using both my laptop and tablet. The laptop for my video and presentation,
the tablet for screen-sharing a scratchpad. The complete thing lasted a little less than
three hours, including the open to all public presentation, a round of questions,
and the session with the thesis committee. The questions were mostly regarding
the content of my thesis and on problems I intend to tackle in the future.
While I associated the defense with an &lt;em&gt;exam&lt;/em&gt;, post facto I would like to
call it a &lt;em&gt;review&lt;/em&gt;. It was interactive, engaging, and not a &lt;em&gt;grilling&lt;/em&gt; experience
as the cliche goes. I was put in a Zoom waiting room by
my academic supervisor, a feature I had not appreciated earlier, and was
eventually called in after about ten minutes. I was told that I passed. Although
I mention that it was not like an exam, the feeling after defense was very much
like getting done with a difficult one &lt;em&gt;successfully&lt;/em&gt;. I caught up with my advisor
later on regarding the review and changes to the thesis suggested by
the committee before submission. I finally submitted on the first week of May.
I’ll leave a link once it is available in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I consider myself very lucky to have stayed healthy throughout
this time and defending successfully. In fact, it was a productive time
and I could get a lot done, making this website. Besides work, I was able to
find time for hobbies, I (re)connected with many friends and extended family
members. Also, being serendipitously together with my finacee during this
time was more than a great support.  Finally, this event also found its
way into the history books of the UWM Physics department as the first
successful virtual defense!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Deep Chatterjee</name><email>deep.chatterjee@ligo.org</email></author><summary type="html">The Ph.D. defense is like the final exam before one is awarded the doctoral degree.

to create a personal website, something I had been waiting to do for a long time.
I was able to create a website in slightly over a weekend with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.
Jekyll is an awesome tool to create static websites, like a personal website or a portfolio.
Another popular tool I came across was &lt;a href=&quot;https://gohugo.io/&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. However, I
decided to stick with Jekyll somehow since I had heard about it earlier. An advantage of
using Jekyll is that you get many options for templates to choose from. In my case, I would
like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://mademistakes.com/&quot;&gt;Michael Rose&lt;/a&gt; for the great looking, feature packed
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/&quot;&gt;Minimal Mistakes&lt;/a&gt; Jekyll template. The
sites are also mobile-friendly. I should also mention that you can also host your Jekyll
website for free via &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;. No ads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jekyll docs and online resources are great places to begin. But, I just wanted to
mention a few things that might make things a little easier (at least it did for me).
Also, what I mention here holds in general and can be considered a &lt;em&gt;good practice&lt;/em&gt;.
Feel free to adopt the principle before you start working on your personal website
with Jekyll, or some other tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;check-if-running-a-container-works-for-you&quot;&gt;Check if running a container works for you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have installation issues with either Jekyll or its dependencies (which is in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;), try the jekyll &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll/&quot;&gt;docker container&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; has become popular in scientific computing
and analysis, specially astrophysics. Also, if you are not an active web developer,
but just want Jekyll for only website, this is the cleanest option in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had a dedicated terminal for the container. After you have installed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;
and pulled down the container using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker pull jekyll/jekyll&lt;/code&gt;, run
the following in this terminal.
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-it&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--publish&lt;/span&gt; 4000 &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--volume&lt;/span&gt; /home/deep/github/:/static-site/ &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; my-jekyll-container &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    jekyll/jekyll bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me break down the options starting from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll/jekyll&lt;/code&gt; is the Jekyll image you pulled down from Dockerhub. In that
container, you will run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Give this container a name. I chose &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;my-jekyll-container&lt;/code&gt;. You can refer
back later to this container using this name.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--volume&lt;/code&gt; does something important. Turns out that a container is like an
independent OS running on your system with its own filesystem. When you exit
a container it removes files you create, unless you make it persistent. Here,
I’m linking my local machine’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home/deep/github/&lt;/code&gt; folder to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/static-site/&lt;/code&gt;
folder of the container. Below is the output of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; in the started &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; process.
        &lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bash-5.0# &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ls
&lt;/span&gt;bin          home         mnt          root         srv          tmp
dev          lib          opt          run          static-site  usr
etc          media        proc         sbin         sys          var
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static-site&lt;/code&gt;, the contents of which will be identical to
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home/deep/github/&lt;/code&gt; of my laptop or local machine. Files created under
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static-site&lt;/code&gt; will be visible outside even after the container is stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--publish&lt;/code&gt; is used to expose ports of the container outside it. Here, I’m
exposing port &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;4000&lt;/code&gt; since the jekyll server runs on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost:4000&lt;/code&gt;. I’ll be
saying more on this later down.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-it&lt;/code&gt;  stands for &lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;nteractive &lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;erminal. It is needed since you will
be entering commands in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; process you just started in the container.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I opened a different terminal window (not running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;) and navigated
to my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home/deep/github&lt;/code&gt; and initiated a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; repository which will host my
static site.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My intention being that I will run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/code&gt; commands from the first terminal to
build and locally &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the website. But for everything else, like editing the
files, or checking out the files to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, I will use the second terminal (or
for that matter as many new terminal tabs I require). &lt;strong&gt;Bottomline&lt;/strong&gt;: One terminal
running Jekyll container to build and serve the website. Other terminal windows
to do eveything else.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now back to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--publish&lt;/code&gt;. Inside of the container you will frequently run
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; which starts the jekyll server for you to see the
website in action. The address is typically &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost:4000&lt;/code&gt;. If you were not
running a container, you will be able to preview the website if you entered this
address in a web browser. However in this case, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; refers
to the container and &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; port &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;4000&lt;/code&gt;. This is why we exposed it using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--publish&lt;/code&gt;.
You need to find out which port outside the container it corresponds to. So
in the second terminal (not running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;) I ran the following,
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker port my-jekyll-container 
4000/tcp -&amp;gt; 0.0.0.0:32769
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;which says container port &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;4000&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to host &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;, port &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;32769&lt;/code&gt;
(the number may be different in your case). So you need to supply this information
to jekyll when running the server. I did the following to start the server inside
the container,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exec &lt;/span&gt;jekyll serve &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--host&lt;/span&gt; 0.0.0.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and then found the preview in a browser when I entered &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost:32769&lt;/code&gt;. That’s
it. So to recap, the terminal with the  container runs the jekyll server, you
make edits and check out files to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; using other terminal windows, and see the
preview on your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-images-are-rotated&quot;&gt;Some images are rotated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue I found when adding images is that some of photos I had taken on
my phone always showed up rotated on the site preview. After some digging around,
I eventually found the issue to be what the orientation of the phone was when
I took the photo (which, of course, you cannot do anything about now). Apparently,
the meta information of the photo was jumbled up as to what was &lt;em&gt;top&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bottom&lt;/em&gt;.
Fortunately, there was a simple fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firstly you need to check if this is the case. Some more digging pointed to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://exiftool.org/&quot;&gt;Exiftool&lt;/a&gt; which is available in package managers.
I installed it and ran the following on the misbehaving images.
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;exiftool &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Orientation&lt;/span&gt; my-image.jpg
Orientation                     : Rotate 90 CW
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This confirmed that indeed this was the case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For me, I tried to open the picture in GIMP which comes pre-installed in
Debian systems, and it asked me rightaway if I wanted to fix the orientation.
All I had to do is to export it with a different filename from GIMP.
Later, I came to know that this also happens with tools like Photoshop.
It was a serendipitous, much welcome fix!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should mention that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&amp;amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Flearning-static-site-building-with-jekyll%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&amp;amp;account=77313426&quot;&gt;LinkedIn course&lt;/a&gt; by Nate Barbettini helped me to get a quick start
with Jekyll. Otherwise, if you decide to use the same template as I did, the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/&quot;&gt;quick start&lt;/a&gt;
should be good enough.
