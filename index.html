<p>
Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM).
</p>

<p>
I work on gravitational-wave astronomy and astrophysics. My research
has been on the emerging field of <b>multi-messenger astronomy</b> with
gravitational waves. But I am curious about all areas of physics.
Whenever I get an opportunity to take a class in a different area, I
take it. My research has also gotten me interested in computation, machine
learning, and some DevOps. Before UWM, I did my integrated BS-MS in physics
from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER),
Kolkata, India. One reason why many students choose to study physics is
because of the application of math in everyday life. I was no different.
</p>

<p>
I am from Kolkata, native Bengali speaker, fluent in English and Hindi.
I also understand a small fraction of Spanish (to the extent Duolingo
teaches you). Apart from work, I love listening to music. I can sing,
and play some guitar. I like to read, cook, and travel.

Feel free to look around. Contact me if you had any comments, bug fixes etc.
