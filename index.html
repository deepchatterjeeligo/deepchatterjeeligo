Hello! I am a Research Scientist at the
<a href="https://space.mit.edu/">MIT Kavli Institute</a>, working
with the <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/MIT">LIGO Lab</a>,
and the <a href="https://a3d3.ai/">A3D3 Institute</a>.
</p>

<p>
I work on gravitational-wave astronomy and astrophysics. My research
is on the emerging field of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-messenger_astronomy">
multi-messenger astronomy</a> with gravitational waves. I am interested
in studying the mergers of compact object like black holes and neutron
stars. They can tell us a lot, from fundamental physics to cosmology, when
observed from multiple angles like gravitational waves, visible and 
infrared light, and high-energy radiation like gamma rays and neutrinos. 
However, their joint observation and data analysis is a challenge
for the community today. Apart from physics, my research made me interested
in high-performance computing, bayesian analysis, machine-learning, and
DevOps technologies.

<p>
I love math its application in the physics of the big and
small, ranging from everyday life to celestial. It is the reason why
I chose to study physics. While my work is in astrophysics, I am
curious about other fields of physics. If there is an interesting
class/lecture offered, I take it (time permit). I obtained my Ph.D.
in physics at <a href="https://uwm.edu/physics/">University of Wisconsin Milwaukee</a>,
where I worked with the LIGO group at <a href="https://cgca.uwm.edu/">CGCA</a>.
Before that I did my integrated BS-MS in physics from Indian Institute of Science Education
and Research (<a href="https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/">IISER</a>), Kolkata.
</p>

<p>
I am from Kolkata, native Bengali speaker, fluent in English and Hindi.
I follow a small amount of Spanish (work in progress). Apart from work,
I love listening to music, play guitar, and sing along. I also like to
read, cook, and travel.
