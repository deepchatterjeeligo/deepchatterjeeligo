Hello! I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Center of AstroPhysical Surveys
(<a href="https://caps.ncsa.illinois.edu/">CAPS</a>) at
<a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/">NCSA</a>, U. Illinois.
</p>

<p>
I work on gravitational-wave astronomy and astrophysics. My research
is on the emerging field of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-messenger_astronomy">
multi-messenger astronomy</a> with gravitational waves. Today, astronomy
has reached an era of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">big data</a>.
The nature of research in this era has gotten me interested in
bayesian analysis, machine-learning, and DevOps tools.
</p>

<p>
I love math, and the application of math in the physics of the big and
small ranging from everyday life to celestial. It is the reason why
I chose to study physics. While my work is in astrophysics, I am
curious about other fields of physics. If there is an interesting
class/lecture offered, I take it (time permit). I obtained my Ph.D.
in physics at U. Wisconsin Milwaukee. Before that I did my integrated
BS-MS in physics from Indian Institute of Science Education
and Research (IISER), Kolkata, India.
</p>

<p>
I am from Kolkata, native Bengali speaker, fluent in English and Hindi.
I follow a small amount of Spanish (work in progress). Apart from work,
I love listening to music, play guitar, and sing along. I also like to
read, cook, and travel. Feel free to look around and contact me if you
find bugs or wanted to chat.
