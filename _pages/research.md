I am a part of the LIGO Scientific collaboration ([LSC](https://www.ligo.org/)) since 2016, and a part of the
Zwicky Transient Factory ([ZTF](https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/project/ztf)) since 2017.

In 2015 gravitational waves (GWs) were directly discovered by the LIGO instruments almost a century after their
prediction by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) in 1916. This was yet another
triumph of general relativity. The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to [Rainer Weiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Weiss),
[Kip Thorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne), and [Barry Barish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Barish)
for the inception of LIGO and their contribution to the observation of GWs. Even more excitement arose in 2017
when both GWs and light was observed simultaneously from the binary neutron star merger [GW170817](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817).
This was the start of _multi-messenger astronomy_ using GWs. It is however challenging to observe these
counterparts since not all GW detections are expected to have accompanying counterparts. Even when they are
present, they are dim and evolve rapidly making it a challenger for observational effort. I work with the LIGO
and ZTF to understand the conditions under which such joint multi-messenger observations are possible, and develop
tools and software which make such discoveries possible.
