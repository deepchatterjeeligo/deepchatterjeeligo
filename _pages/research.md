I am a part of the LIGO Scientific collaboration ([LSC](https://www.ligo.org/)) since 2016.
During my postdoc, I worked with the [LSST DESC Collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org/).
I have also worked with the Zwicky Transient Factory ([ZTF](https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/project/ztf))
during my Ph.D.

In 2015, gravitational waves (GWs) were directly discovered by the LIGO instruments almost a century after their
prediction by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) in 1916. This was yet another
triumph of general relativity. The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to [Rainer Weiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Weiss),
[Kip Thorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne), and [Barry Barish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Barish)
for the inception of LIGO and their contribution to the observation of GWs. Even more excitement arose in 2017
when both GWs and light was observed simultaneously from the binary neutron star merger [GW170817](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817).
This was the start of _multi-messenger astronomy_ using GWs. It is however challenging to observe these
counterparts since not all GW detections are expected to have accompanying counterparts. Even when they are
present, they are dim and evolve rapidly, making it a challenge for observational effort. Within LIGO,
I study the conditions when such joint multi-messenger observations are possible, and
develop tools and data products which make such discoveries possible. My research is interdisciplinary -
aside from general relativity, one has to use results from several different areas like nuclear
physics and high-energy astrophysics. Computing plays a big role in the implementation for most
data analysis techniques, with  machine learning starting to play a bigger role nowadays.
Apart from multi-messenger astronomy, I am interested in gravitational-wave
cosmology. There is a tension in the measured value of the Hubble constant, between the two established
probes - type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background. Gravitational waves provide an independent
probe for measurement of the Hubble constant. Future measurement from gravitational waves could solve the hubble
tension. I develop different techniques that could make such a measurement from gravitational waves.
