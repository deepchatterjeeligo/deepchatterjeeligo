## UWM and Milwaukee
I came to Milwaukee in 2015, to start graduate school at UW-Milwaukee.
It's a beautiful city on Lake Michigan. The lake basically looks like
an ocean as you can see in the photo above taken on a cold February
morning.

It is cold for most of the year. But the summers are amazing. Being from
Kolkata, India, I had never seen snow earlier. I saw a lot of it in
Milwaukee. I will update this page with suggestions, specially for new
students. Until then have a look at the gallery below.
